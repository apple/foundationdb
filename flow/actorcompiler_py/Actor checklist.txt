Compile issues:

- wait() must always assign the resulting value to a newly declared variable.

- Variables used across a "wait() boundary" must be declared state


Remember to:

- Add useful ASSERT()s

- Add BUGGIFY() statements to expose rare cases to simulation

- Add TEST() statements to any conditional/rare cases

- Comment invariants, strategy, preconditions, tricky stuff when you
	figure it out, even if it's not "your" code.

- Factor common asynchronous control flows to use composition
	of generic actors such as: 
		waitForAll
		timeout
		splitFuture
		recurring
		smartQuorum
		AsyncMap
		broadcast
		&&, ||
		etc...

- Declare classes NonCopyable unless they are, and you know what
	that means


Run time issues:

- Is the actor return type "void"? Make sure that some exception or	timeout
	will trigger eventually to clean up the actor.

- If you send a future to another future, a long-lived forwardPromise
	actor is created--make sure that the event happens eventually to free
	this actor.

- If you return a Future<T> instead of a T from an actor, a forwardPromise
	actor is created with the same lifetime issues as above.

- Remember that parameters are internally passed to the actor as const &
	and then copied into actor state variables

- When you use *GetReply() or LoadBalance(), the "server" responding to
	your request might get your request multiple times.

- When you use getReply() instead of tryGetReply() you must ensure that the
	actor will be cancelled if the service you are trying to connect to is
	no longer available. (Otherwise, an infinite waiting loop)

- For each wait:

	- An actor_cancelled exception can be thrown if the actor's return
		value future is dropped.

	- An exception can arrive instead of a value

	- What happens if it never returns?

	- If the client fulfilling the wait is coming over the network, you
		might get the same request multiple times


Performance issues:

- Wait a little extra time before doing something time-consuming or
	irreversible to see	if it is still necessary.

- When waiting for a number of things, wait a little extra time to get
	the stragglers. (See the SmartQuorum() generic actor)

- If asking another asynchronous server to do units of work, don't queue up more
	work than is necessary to keep the server busy. Likewise, if you are
	busy, let your own work queue fill up to signal your requester
	that you are blocked. Also do this personally with managers assigning
	you stuff.

- Pass all variables as "const &" if their size is greater than 8 bytes.
