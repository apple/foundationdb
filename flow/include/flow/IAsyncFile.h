// All outstanding operations must be cancelled before the destructor of IAsyncFile is called.
// The desirability of the above semantic is disputed. Some classes (AsyncFileS3BlobStore,
// AsyncFileCached) maintain references, while others (AsyncFileNonDurable) don't, and the comment
// is unapplicable to some others as well (AsyncFileKAIO). It's safest to assume that all operations
// must complete or cancel, but you should probably look at the file implementations you'll be using.
//
// Wrapper classes such as AsyncFileWriteChecker and AsyncFileChaos ideally should be safe to destroy with
// pending operations as they are inserted randomly into file opens in simulation and some use cases
// will drop file references while operations are still pending.
