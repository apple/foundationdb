This guide walks through installing a locally accessible FoundationDB server that is suitable for development on macOS.

.. note:: |platform-not-supported-for-production|

First steps
===========

* Validate that your system has

  * x86-64 processor architecture
  * 4 GB RAM (per process)
  * macOS 10.7 or newer

* Download the FoundationDB packages for your system from :doc:`downloads`.

* Before upgrading from a previous version of FoundationDB, see :ref:`upgrading-foundationdb`.

Installing or upgrading FoundationDB
====================================

To begin installation, double-click on |package-mac|. Follow the instructions and select the components that you want to install. 

Client-only installation
------------------------

By default, the FoundationDB installer installs the binaries required to run both clients and a local development server. If you don't intend to run the FoundationDB server on your machine, you can deselect the "FoundationDB Server" option. Copy the :ref:`cluster file <foundationdb-cluster-file>` from a server or client in the cluster you want to connect to and place it in ``/usr/local/etc/foundationdb/``.

Testing your FoundationDB installation
======================================

To verify that the local FoundationDB database is operational, open the command line interface (``fdbcli``) and use the status command. ::

  host:~ user$ fdbcli
  Using cluster file `/usr/local/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster'.

  The database is available.

  Welcome to the fdbcli. For help, type `help'.
  fdb> status

  Configuration:
    Redundancy mode        - single
    Storage engine         - memory
    Coordinators           - 1

  Cluster:
    FoundationDB processes - 1
    Machines               - 1
    Memory availability    - 4.1 GB per process on machine with least available
    Fault Tolerance        - 0 machines
    Server time            - Thu Mar 15 14:41:34 2018
    
  Data:
    Replication health     - Healthy
    Moving data            - 0.000 GB
    Sum of key-value sizes - 8 MB
    Disk space used        - 103 MB

  Operating space:
    Storage server         - 1.0 GB free on most full server
    Transaction log        - 1.0 GB free on most full server

  Workload:
    Read rate              - 2 Hz
    Write rate             - 0 Hz
    Transactions started   - 2 Hz
    Transactions committed - 0 Hz
    Conflict rate          - 0 Hz

  Backup and DR:
    Running backups        - 0
    Running DRs            - 0

  Client time: Thu Mar 15 14:41:34 2018

If these steps were successful you have installed and validated FoundationDB. You can now start using the database!

.. note:: If the database is not operational the ``status`` command will provide diagnostic information to help you resolve the issue.

Managing the FoundationDB service
==================================

* See :ref:`administration-running-foundationdb`.
* See :ref:`administration-removing`.

Next steps
==========

* Install the APIs for :doc:`Ruby <api-ruby>`, `Java <https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.foundationdb/fdb-java/latest/index.html>`_, or `Go <https://godoc.org/github.com/apple/foundationdb/bindings/go/src/fdb>`_ if you intend to use those languages.  :doc:`Python <api-python>` and :doc:`C <api-c>` APIs were installed using the FoundationDB installer above.
* See :doc:`tutorials` for samples of developing applications with FoundationDB.
* See :doc:`developer-guide` for information of interest to developers, including common design patterns and performance considerations.
* See :doc:`administration` for detailed administration information.
* See :doc:`known-limitations` of the system.
