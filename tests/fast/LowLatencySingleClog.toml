# The LowLatency workload expects quick recoveries, otherwise it throws a SevError of Type=LatencyTooLarge.
# This conflicts with fault injection testing for cc_recovery_init_req_* knobs, where we
# intentionally drop init requests from CC during recovery to test timeout behavior.
# In such fault injection cases, recovery restarts but the reaction time can be
# too slow for the LowLatency workload requirements.
# To address this, we disable dropping init requests for this test.
