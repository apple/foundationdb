# Test configuration for S3Client workload
# This test verifies that the S3 client can upload, download, and delete a file to an S3 bucket.
# Requires local instance of seaweedfs up and running and the below s3Url pointing at it.
# One way to do this is:
# source foundationdb/fdbclient/tests/seaweeds_fixture.sh
#  mkdir ~/weed
#  run_weed ~/weed/ ~/weed/
# After the server comes up it will output where the service is running, something like
# localhost:8335. Use this input composing the s3url below (use '127.0.0.1' in place of 'localhost').
#  ...
# When done, run:
#  shutdown_weed ~/weed

# Disable all fault injection and network failures
# buggify = false now controls ALL fault injection systems (BUGGIFY, failure workloads, AND global fault injection)
buggify = false
