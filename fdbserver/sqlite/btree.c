** Set bit pgno of the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. This is called

**
** The BtShared.pHasContent bitvec exists to work around an obscure
** bug caused by the interaction of two useful IO optimizations surrounding
** free-list leaf pages:
**
**   1) When all data is deleted from a page and the page becomes
**      a free-list leaf page, the page is not written to the database
**      (as free-list leaf pages contain no meaningful data). Sometimes
**      such a page is not even journalled (as it will not be modified,
**      why bother journalling it?).
**
**   2) When a free-list leaf page is reused, its content is not read
**      from the database or written to the journal file (why should it
**      be, if it is not at all meaningful?).
**
** By themselves, these optimizations work fine and provide a handy
** performance boost to bulk delete or insert operations. However, if
** a page is moved to the free-list and then reused within the same
** transaction, a problem comes up. If the page is not journalled when
** it is moved to the free-list and it is also not journalled when it
** is extracted from the free-list and reused, then the original data
** may be lost. In the event of a rollback, it may not be possible
** to restore the database to its original configuration.
**
** The solution is the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. Whenever a page is
** moved to become a free-list leaf page, the corresponding bit is
** set in the bitvec. Whenever a leaf page is extracted from the free-list,
** optimization 2 above is omitted if the corresponding bit is already

**
** If an exact match is not found, then the cursor is always

**
** An integer is written into *pRes which is the result of

** *pRes is as follows:
**
**     *pRes<0      The cursor is left pointing at an entry that
**                  is smaller than intKey/pIdxKey or if the table is empty
**                  and the cursor is therefore left point to nothing.
**
**     *pRes==0     The cursor is left pointing at an entry that
**                  exactly matches intKey/pIdxKey.
**
**     *pRes>0      The cursor is left pointing at an entry that
**                  is larger than intKey/pIdxKey.

** side if the page is the first or last child of its parent. If the page
** has fewer than 2 siblings (something which can only happen if the page
** is a root page or a child of a root page) then all available siblings
** participate in the balancing.
**
** The number of siblings of the page might be increased or decreased by
** one or two in an effort to keep pages nearly full but not over full.
**
** Note that when this routine is called, some of the cells on the page
** might not actually be stored in MemPage.aData[]. This can happen
** if the page is overfull. This routine ensures that all cells allocated
** to the page and its siblings fit into MemPage.aData[] before returning.
**
** In the course of balancing the page and its siblings, cells may be
** inserted into or removed from the parent page (pParent). Doing so
** may cause the parent page to become overfull or underfull. If this
** happens, it is the responsibility of the caller to invoke the correct
** balancing routine to fix this problem (see the balance() routine).
**
** If this routine fails for any reason, it might leave the database
** in a corrupted state. So if this routine fails, the database should
** be rolled back.
**
** The third argument to this function, aOvflSpace, is a pointer to a
** buffer big enough to hold one page. If while inserting cells into the parent
** page (pParent) the parent page becomes overfull, this buffer is
** used to store the parent's overflow cells. Because this function inserts
** a maximum of four divider cells into the parent page, and the maximum
** size of a cell stored within an internal node is always less than 1/4
** of the page-size, the aOvflSpace[] buffer is guaranteed to be large
** enough for all overflow cells.
