/* BackupContainerFileSystem implements a backup container which stores files in a nested folder structure.
 * Inheritors must only defined methods for writing, reading, deleting, sizing, and listing files.
 *
 *   Snapshot manifests (a complete set of files constituting a database snapshot for the backup's target ranges)
 *   are stored as JSON files at paths like
 *       /snapshots/snapshot,minVersion,maxVersion,totalBytes
 *
 *   Key range files for snapshots are stored at paths like
 *       /kvranges/snapshot,startVersion/N/range,version,uid,blockSize
 *     where startVersion is the version at which the backup snapshot execution began and N is a number
 *     that is increased as key range files are generated over time (at varying rates) such that there
 *     are around 5,000 key range files in each folder.
 *
 *     Note that startVersion will NOT correspond to the minVersion of a snapshot manifest because
 *     snapshot manifest min/max versions are based on the actual contained data and the first data
 *     file written will be after the start version of the snapshot's execution.
 *
 *   Log files are at file paths like
 *       /plogs/.../log,startVersion,endVersion,UID,tagID-of-N,blocksize
 *       /logs/.../log,startVersion,endVersion,UID,blockSize
 *     where ... is a multi level path which sorts lexically into version order and results in approximately 1
 *     unique folder per day containing about 5,000 files. Logs after FDB 6.3 are stored in "plogs"
 *     directory and are partitioned according to tagIDs (0, 1, 2, ...) and the total number partitions is N.
 *     Old backup logs FDB 6.2 and earlier are stored in "logs" directory and are not partitioned.
 *     After FDB 6.3, users can choose to use the new partitioned logs or old logs.
 *
 *
 *   BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
 *
 *   Prior to FDB version 6.0.16, key range files were stored using a different folder scheme.  Newer versions
 *   still support this scheme for all restore and backup management operations but key range files generated
 *   by backup using version 6.0.16 or later use the scheme describe above.
 *
 *   The old format stored key range files at paths like
 *       /ranges/.../range,version,uid,blockSize
 *     where ... is a multi level path with sorts lexically into version order and results in up to approximately
 *     900 unique folders per day.  The number of files per folder depends on the configured snapshot rate and
 *     database size and will vary from 1 to around 5,000.
