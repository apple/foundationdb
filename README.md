FoundationDB is a distributed database designed to handle large volumes of structured data across clusters of commodity servers. It organizes data as an ordered key-value store and employs ACID transactions for all operations. It is especially well-suited for read/write workloads, but also has excellent performance for write-intensive workloads. Users interact with the database using API language binding.

## Getting Started

### Latest Stable Releases

The latest stable releases are (were) versions that are recommended for production use, which have been extensively validated via simulation and real cluster tests and used in our production environment.

| Branch   |     Latest Production Release      |  Notes |
|:--------:|:-------------:|------:|
| 7.3      |  [7.3.63](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/tag/7.3.63) | Supported |
| 7.2      |   | Experimental |
| 7.1      |  [7.1.57](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/tag/7.1.57)   |   Bug fixes |
| 7.0      |           |   Experimental |
| 6.3      |  [6.3.25](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/tag/6.3.25) |   Unsupported |

- `Supported` branches are those we actively maintain and will publish new patch releases.
- `Bug fixes` are branches where we still accept bug fixes, but may not publish newer patch releases. The community can build the latest release binaries if needed and is encouraged to upgrade to the `Supported` branches.
- `Experimental` branches are those used for internal feature testing. They are not recommended for production use.
- `Unsupported` branches are those that will no longer receive any updates.

If you are running on old production releases, we recommend always upgrading to the next major release's latest version, and then continuing to the next major version, e.g., 6.2.X -> 6.3.25 -> 7.1.57 -> 7.3.63. These upgrade paths have been well tested in production (skipping a major release, not marked as `Experimental`, for an upgrade is only tested in simulation).

### Binary Downloads

Developers interested in using FoundationDB can get started by downloading and installing a binary package. Please see the [downloads page](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases) for a list of available packages.


### Compiling from source

Developers on an OS for which there is no binary package, or who would like to start hacking on the code, can get started by compiling from source.

#### Build Locally

To build outside of the official Docker image, you'll need at least these dependencies:

1. [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.24.2 or higher 
1. [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)
1. [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

If compiling for local development, please set `-DUSE_WERROR=ON` in CMake. Our CI compiles with `-Werror` on, so this way you'll find out about compiler warnings that break the build earlier.

Once you have your dependencies, you can run `cmake` and then build:

1. Check out this repository.
1. Create a build directory (you can place it anywhere you like).
1. `cd <FDB_BUILD_DIR>`
1. `cmake -G Ninja <FDB_SOURCE_DIR>`
1. `ninja`

Building FoundationDB requires at least 8GB of memory. More memory is needed when building in parallel. If the computer freezes or crashes, consider disabling parallelized build using `ninja -j1`.

#### Build Using the Official Docker Image

The official Docker image for building is [`foundationdb/build`](https://hub.docker.com/r/foundationdb/build), which includes all necessary dependencies. The Docker image definitions used by FoundationDB team members can be found in the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-build-support). When building inside the container, it is required to use the compilers in the `toolset` subdirectory. To enable the `toolset`, import the environment variables by

``` bash
source /opt/rh/gcc-toolset-13/enable
```

before executing CMake and ninja.

To build FoundationDB with the clang toolchain,

``` bash
CC=clang CXX=clang++ LD=lld cmake -D USE_LD=LLD -D USE_LIBCXX=1 -G Ninja
ninja
```

should be used instead.

#### FreeBSD

1. Check out this repo on your server.

1. Install compile-time dependencies from ports.

1. (Optional) Use tmpfs & ccache for significantly faster repeat builds

1. (Optional) Install a [JDK](https://www.freshports.org/java/openjdk8/) for Java Bindings. FoundationDB currently builds with Java 8.

1. Navigate to the directory where you checked out the FoundationDB repository.

1. Build from source.

   ```shell
   sudo pkg install -r FreeBSD \
       shells/bash devel/cmake devel/ninja devel/ccache  \
       lang/mono lang/python3 \
       devel/boost-libs devel/libeio \
       security/openssl
   mkdir .build && cd .build
   cmake -G Ninja \
       -DUSE_CCACHE=on \
       -DUSE_DTRACE=off \
       ..
   ninja -j 10
   # run fast tests
   ctest -L fast
   # run all tests
   ctest --output-on-failure -v
   ```

### macOS

The build under macOS will work the same way as on Linux. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can be used to install the `boost` library and the `ninja` build tool.

```sh
cmake -G Ninja <FDB_SOURCE_DIR>
ninja
```

To generate an installable package,

```sh
<FDB_SOURCE_DIR>/packaging/osx/buildpkg.sh . <FDB_SOURCE_DIR>
```

### Windows

Under Windows, only Visual Studio with ClangCl is supported

1. Install Visual Studio 2019 (IDE or Build Tools), and enable LLVM support
1. Install  [CMake 3.24.2](https://cmake.org/download/) or higher
1. Download [Boost 1.86.0](https://archives.boost.io/release/1.86.0/source/boost_1_86_0.tar.bz2)
1. Unpack boost to C:\boost, or use `-DBOOST_ROOT=<PATH_TO_BOOST>` with `cmake` if unpacked elsewhere
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if it is not already installed by Visual Studio
1. (Optional) Install [OpenJDK 11](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download) to build Java bindings
1. (Optional) Install [OpenSSL 3.x](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) to build with TLS support
1. (Optional) Install [WIX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) to build the Windows installer
1. `mkdir build && cd build`
1. `cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -T ClangCl <FDB_SOURCE_DIR>`
1. `msbuild /p:Configuration=Release foundationdb.sln`
1. To increase build performance, use `/p:UseMultiToolTask=true` and `/p:CL_MPCount=<NUMBER_OF_PARALLEL_JOBS>` 

### Language Bindings

The language bindings that CMake supports will have a corresponding `README.md` file in the `bindings/lang` directory corresponding to each language.

Generally, CMake will build all language bindings for which it can find all necessary dependencies. After each successful CMake run, CMake will tell you which language bindings it is going to build.


### Generating `compile_commands.json`

CMake can build a compilation database for you. However, the default generated one is not too useful as it operates on the generated files. When running `ninja`, the build system creates another `compile_commands.json` file in the source directory. This can then be used for tools such as  [CCLS](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) and [CQuery](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery), among others. This way, you can get code completion and code navigation in flow. It is not yet perfect (it will show a few errors), but we are continually working to improve the development experience.

CMake will not produce a `compile_commands.json` by default; you must pass `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`.  This also enables the target `processed_compile_commands`, which rewrites `compile_commands.json` to describe the actor compiler source file, not the post-processed output files, and places the output file in the source directory.  This file should then be picked up automatically by any tooling.

Note that if the building is done inside the `foundationdb/build` Docker image, the resulting paths will still be incorrect and require manual fixing. One will wish to re-run `cmake` with `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=OFF` to prevent it from reverting the manual changes.

### Using IDEs

CMake provides built-in support for several popular IDEs. However, most FoundationDB files are written in the `flow` language, which is an extension of the C++ programming language,  for coroutine support (Note that when FoundationDB was being developed, C++20 was not available). The `flow` language will be transpiled into C++ code using `actorcompiler`, while preventing most IDEs from recognizing `flow`-specific syntax.

It is possible to generate project files for editing `flow` with a supported IDE. There is a CMake option called `OPEN_FOR_IDE`, which creates a project that can be opened in an IDE for editing. This project cannot be built, but you will be able to edit the files and utilize most of the editing and navigation features that your IDE supports.

For example, if you want to use Xcode to make changes to FoundationDB, you can create an Xcode project with the following command:

```sh
cmake -G Xcode -DOPEN_FOR_IDE=ON <FDB_SOURCE_DIRECTORY>
```

A second build directory with the `OPEN_FOR_IDE` flag off can be created for building and debugging purposes.
